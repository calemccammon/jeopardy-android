<b>Jeopardy Android</b><br/>
Author: Cale McCammon

Jeopardy Android brings the game of Jeopardy to the Android platform. The rules are basically the same as
the official game: The player answers trivia questions. If the answer is wrong, you lost points. If the
answer is right, you gain points. There is no Daily Double or anything like that -- just question and 
answer.

Jeopardy Android relies on the jService API found here: http://jservice.io/. The APdI provides the 
clues' information, including: category title, answer, dollar value, and so on.

Jeopardy Android is my first Android application. It features a drawer menu with fragment creation, 
API web calls, network connection error handling,  snackbar messages, and persistent data through shared preferences, 
among others.

Please note: Jeopardy Android has no afiliation with Jeopardy Productions and is made available solely 
for educational purposes.
